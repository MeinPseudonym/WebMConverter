Hello,

In case you didn't know, I ran into issues with GitHub the other day.
In order for WebM for Retards to remain hosted on their service, they demanded I remove "Retards" from the name of the program.

As a result, I have decided to move away from GitHub to GitGud. Unfortunately, due to insufficient preparation in my updater code, I can't make you get automatic updates unless I use this dialog to make you install the new version.

To download the new future-proofed version of WebM for Retards (with an improved updater!), please press Yes.
If you press No, you will not see this dialog again, but if you change your mind later, go to:

Some people may not get this popup, so I hope you can spread the word!
